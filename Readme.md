## Description

Swift Apply Assistant is an innovative auto form-filling application designed to streamline the process of completing Google Forms. By leveraging modern technologies such as browser extensions, the Chrome Storage API, and JSON file formats, this tool automates the repetitive and time-consuming task of manual data entry. Users can input key-value pairs where the key refers to the Google Form label and the value is the desired input, enabling efficient and error-free form submissions. The system supports multilingual labels and values, enhancing its versatility and accessibility. This application significantly improves user experience by saving time, reducing errors, and promoting inclusivity for users with disabilities.
